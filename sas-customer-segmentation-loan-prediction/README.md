# Customer Segmentation & Loan Prediction (SAS Viya)

**Tools:** SAS Viya (Clustering, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)  
**Dataset:** Banking customer demographic & transaction data  

## 📌 Objective
Segment banking customers into distinct groups and build models to predict loan approval likelihood.

## 🛠️ Approach
- Performed **exploratory data analysis** on income, transactions, credit scores, and loan status.  
- Applied **K-Means Clustering** to divide customers into 10 meaningful segments:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
- Built **Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models** to predict loan approvals.  
- Compared models on Accuracy, Precision, and F1 Score.  

## 📊 Results
- Identified 10 customer groups: *High-Income Savers*, *Young Professionals*, *Retirees*, etc.  
- Logistic Regression achieved **71% accuracy**, while Decision Tree achieved **74% precision**.  
- Recommended Decision Tree model for minimizing false approvals.
