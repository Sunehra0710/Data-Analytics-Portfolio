# Consumer Preference Analytics (JMP)

**Tools:** JMP Pro  
**Dataset:** Consumer Preferences.jmp (floss, brush, toothpaste, demographics)  

## 📌 Objective
Analyze consumer preferences to understand behavior, segment users, and build predictive models.  

## 🛠️ Approach
- Conducted **descriptive analysis** with histograms and bar charts (salary, gender, marital status).  
- Built **scatterplots and bubble plots** to analyze salary, age, and job tenure:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  
- Applied **K-Means Clustering** to group consumers into 3 segments.  
- Used **Decision Tree partitioning** to predict brushing behavior.  
- Performed **Regression Analysis** on salary vs. age.  

## 📊 Results
- Found gender & marital status as key demographic factors.  
- Identified 3 consumer clusters (e.g., Young Professionals, Mid-Career, Long-Term Employees).  
- Regression showed clear positive correlation between **age and salary growth**.
