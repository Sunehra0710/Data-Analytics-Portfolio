# Production Optimization & Simulation (RStudio)

**Tools:** R, lpSolve, ggplot2  
**Dataset:** Manufacturing resource allocation & profitability data  

## 📌 Objective
Use prescriptive analytics to optimize production planning and evaluate investment opportunities.  

## 🛠️ Approach
- Formulated **linear programming models** with resource constraints:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  
- Applied **lpSolve** in R to maximize revenue given limited labor and materials.  
- Simulated company profitability under multiple scenarios (Monte Carlo).  
- Visualized feasible regions and optimal solutions using **ggplot2**.  

## 📊 Results
- Optimal product mix: *111 units A, 4 units B, 59 units C* for **$3,618 maximum profit**.  
- Recommended **Company A** for investment based on higher expected profitability.
